# GuavaDiseaseDetection
This project detects the diseases of Guava fruits using convolution neural networks (CNN). Guava disease has become a major issue for guava production, which has a negative impact on farmers' socioeconomic growth. Infections that harm guava plants and fruits pose the greatest obstacles, although they can be avoided by early identification.
